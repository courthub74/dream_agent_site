Some Improvements: 9/30/2025

Breadcrumbs: You already have “Collections › Symbols In Motion,” but adding subtle hover interaction (fade/underline) makes navigation feel alive.

Mobile Scaling: Ensure the long text block collapses or uses a “Read More” toggle to avoid overwhelming small screens.

Mood Accent: Try a subtle parallax background behind the main artwork image, so the painting feels like it’s floating in its own symbolic space.

Collector Badges: Add small tags like “New,” “Rare,” “Featured” in the “All Works” sidebar to gamify browsing.
